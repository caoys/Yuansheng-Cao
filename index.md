## Welcome to the website of Yuansheng Cao
I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at UC San Diego, where I apply physics techniques to a wide range of cell biology problems, including single- and multi-cell migration. I joined UC San Diego after completing a PhD in physics at Peking University (PKU), where I used nonequilibrium thermodynamics to study biological networks.

## Research Interests and Experiences
Long term goal: to understand the complex spatiotemporal dynamics in biology using physical and mathematical principles. 

**Mechanochemical coupling in cell and developmental biology**

In cell biology, a major challenge to understand cell behaviors and migration is that cellular signaling events are coupled with cellular mechanics. Things are even complicated _in vivo_ because cells are encountered with multiple physical and chemical signals. I'm interested in using computational models to study those coupling processes. However, traditional computational methods are difficult to track those problems because we have to track both the cell morphology and biochemical reactions, which are entangled at cellular level. The phase field method, which is my main focus at UCSD, is designed to solve those coupling problems. I want to build an _in silico_ cell (computation models) to study the feedback between cellular signaling and cell mechanics. This model can then be coupled to complex environments, e.g., with geometric confinement or chemoattractant. I wish to understand the strategy of path selection of cell movements when both physical and chemical cues are present. The ultimate target is cancer metastasis, where it has already been shown that gene expression, cellular signaling and extra-cellular matrixes are all important factors to initiate the migration of cancer cells. Computational models can be very useful to form an integrative view on how cancer cells start to move.

In developmental biology, we are facing similar challenges. The morphogenesis processes in many systems are entangled with gene expression, intra- or inter-cellular signaling and cell or tissue mechanics. Computational models with all those factors integrated together can help us understand why the developmental processes are so highly coordinated. One example is the formation of somite patterns in vertebrate animals. The somite patterns are controlled by a set of cellular oscillators and traveling waves. I want to see how precise are timing and position of somite patterns are formed in real systems (like Drosophila) and what are the fundamental limits of controling timing and positional information. This study can help us understand how the system is optimized/evolved to achieve best performance and can be directly compared with quantitative data. Another unique challenge in developmental biology is that the morphogenesis is usually a multi-cell rearrangement process, which involves cell division and cell movements. I want to use computational models to study the dynamic organization of cells and see how cell rearrangement lead to tissue or organ-level morphology. 

Open to all possibilities.

**Physical laws as fundamental constraints to information processing and self-organization in living systems**

This is about physical constraint to biology, but it also brings new opportunities from biology to physics, perhaps even establish new physics. One powerful law is the nonequilibrium thermodynamics and statistics, because all living systems are out of equlibrium, i.e., they consume ATP or GTP to stay funtional. One example from my research experience is that, the precision and sensitivity of biochemial oscillations and circadian clocks, are constrained by the energy dissipation of the clock. I want to extend my work and use nonequilibrium thermodynamics as a unified framework to understand information processing and self-organization in biology. For example, cells use GPCRs which consumes GTP to sense shallow concentration gradient, I want to know how GTP consumption affect the sensitivity of gradient sensing, by using theoretical models. Self-organizations are also active processes which consume free energy. One example is the super-enhancers in transcription through a so-called "phase-separation" mechanism. I'm interested in the role of energetics in such a mechanism and want to know how it leads to super-sensitivity.  Another example is pattern formation in biology which is also nonequilibrium.  I'm interested in how energetic molecules are distributed spatiotemporally to make accurate patterns. These studies can help reveal the principles of utilizing free energy to achieve accuracy in noisy living systems.

All those studies will converge to experiments.
