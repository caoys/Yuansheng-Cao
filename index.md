## Research Interests and Experiences
I am interested in theoretical and computational approaches to understand the **dynamics** and **thermodynamics** of complex spatiotemporal behaviors in cell and developmental biology at a broad range of scales. I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at UC San Diego, where I apply physics techniques to a wide range of cell biology problems, including single- and multi-cell migration. I joined UC San Diego after completing a PhD in physics at Peking University (PKU), where I used nonequilibrium thermodynamics to study biological networks.
